"""
Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Apple:

You are given a binary tree representation of an arithmetic expression. In this tree, each leaf is an integer value,, and a non-leaf node is one of the four operations: '+', '-', '*', or '/'.

Write a function that takes this tree and evaluates the expression.

Example:

    *
   / \
  +    +
 / \  / \
3  2  4  5

This is a representation of the expression (3 + 2) * (4 + 5), and should return 45.
