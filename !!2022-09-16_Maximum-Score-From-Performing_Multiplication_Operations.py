'''
1770. Maximum Score from Performing Multiplication Operations

You are given two integer arrays nums and multipliers of size n and m respectively, where n >= m. The arrays are 1-indexed.

You begin with a score of 0. You want to perform exactly m operations. On the ith operation (1-indexed), you will:

Choose one integer x from either the start or the end of the array nums.
Add multipliers[i] * x to your score.
Remove x from the array nums.
Return the maximum score after performing m operations.

Constraints:

n == nums.length
m == multipliers.length
1 <= m <= 103
m <= n <= 105
-1000 <= nums[i], multipliers[i] <= 1000
